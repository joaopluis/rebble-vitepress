# Resources

Resources are data files that are bundled with your application binary and can be loaded at runtime. You use resources to embed images or custom fonts in your app, but also to embed any data file. Resources are always read-only.

Resources are stored on Pebble’s flash memory and only loaded in RAM when you load them. This means that you can have a large number of resources embedded inside your app, even though Pebble’s RAM memory is very limited.

See  for information on how to embed resources into your app's bundle.
