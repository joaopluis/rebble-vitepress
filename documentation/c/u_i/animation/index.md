# Animation

The Animation framework provides your Pebble app with an base layer to create arbitrary animations. The simplest way to work with animations is to use the layer frame [PropertyAnimation](/documentation/c/group___property_animation.md), which enables you to move a Layer around on the screen. Using [animation_set_implementation()](/documentation/c/group___animation.md#function-animation-set-implementation), you can implement a custom animation.

Refer to the  (chapter "Animation") for a conceptual overview of the animation framework and on how to write custom animations.
