# Appstore Publishing

When a developer is happy that their app is feature-complete and stable, they
can upload the compiled `.pbw` file to the 
[Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.rebble.io) to make it available on the
Pebble appstore for all users with compatible watches to share and enjoy.

In order to be successfully listed in the Pebble appstore the developer must:

* Provide all required assets and marketing material.

* Provide at least one `.pbw` release.

* Use a unique and valid UUID.

* Build their app with a non-beta SDK.

* Ensure their app complies with the various legal agreements.

Information on how to meet these requirements is given in this group of guides,
as well as details about available analytical data for published apps and
example asset material templates.
