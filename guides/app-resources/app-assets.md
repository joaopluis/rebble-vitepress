# App Assets

This guide contains some resources available for developers to use in their apps
to improve consistency, as well as for convenience. For example, most
``ActionBarLayer`` implementations will require at least one of the common icons
given below.


## Pebble Timeline Pin Icons

Many timeline pin icons 
[are available]({{ $config.s3assets }}/assets/other/pebble-timeline-icons-pdc.zip) 
in Pebble Draw Command or PDC format (as described in 
{% guide_link graphics-and-animations/vector-graphics %}) for use in watchfaces
and watchapps. These are useful in many kinds of generic apps.


## Example PDC icon SVG Files

Many of the system PDC animations are available for use in watchfaces and
watchapps as part of the 
[`pdc-sequence`](https://github.com/pebble-examples/pdc-sequence/tree/master/resources) 
example project.
