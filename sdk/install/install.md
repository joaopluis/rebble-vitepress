# Installing the Pebble SDK

## Develop Online

You can use [CloudPebble]({{$CLOUDPEBBLE_URL}}) to build, compile
and test Pebble apps entirely in the cloud without any installation needed.

## Install Through Homebrew

We recommend Mac OS X users [install the SDK using Homebrew](/sdk/download).

## Manual Installation

Once you have [downloaded the Pebble SDK](/sdk/download/), you will need to
follow the instructions for your platform.
