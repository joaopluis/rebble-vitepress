# Installing the Pebble SDK

The Pebble SDK allows you to write apps and watchfaces for Pebble. There are _many_ installation methods.

The recomended approach is a native installation:

If installing on Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux, [follow this guide](https://willow.systems/blog/pebble-sdk-installation-guide/).

If installing on Arch Linux, [follow this guide](https://github.com/pebble-dev/RebbleOS/blob/master/docs/arch_build.md).

If installing on Windows or MacOS, [see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/9i9aqy/developing_for_pebble_without_cloudpebble_windows/).

## Virtual machine

The easiest installation option is the [Pebble Virtual Machine](https://rebble.io/hackathon-002/vm/).

## Nix package

If youâ€™re using NixOS, you can install via the [nix package](https://github.com/Sorixelle/pebble.nix).

## Docker image

You can also install via the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rebble/pebble-sdk), though getting the emulator to work is an involved, undocumented procedure.

For support, assistance, or general questions, come and talk to other Pebble developers on the [Rebble Discord](https://rebble.io/discord).
